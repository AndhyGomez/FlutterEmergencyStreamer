An app that will provide a discrete method of recording and streaming a live video feed to a server when needed.
 
## Motivation
We live in a society wherein we might find ourselves in grave danger from one moment to the next. While leading our normal lives a regular day could take a turn for the worst, not only because of the many dangerous criminals that could hurt us, but also because of the people in positions of power that try to abuse us with no consequences.This app seeks to give people the ability to record secretly and safely while in a dangerous or abusive situation. 

## Compatibility
This app was created using the Flutter framework and the Dart programming language and is fully operational on both IOS and Android.
